# Random Password Generator
This is a simple web application that generates a random password based on the user's preferences. The user can choose the password length and include various character types such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric digits, and special characters.

# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

Open the index.html file in your web browser. The application interface will appear, showing various options for password generation.

Enter the desired password length (between 8 and 128 characters) in the prompt. The password should be at least 8 characters long for security reasons.

You will then be prompted to include or exclude certain character types in the password:

- Confirm whether to include lowercase letters in the password.
- Confirm whether to include uppercase letters in the password.
- Confirm whether to include numeric digits in the password.
- Confirm whether to include special characters (e.g., ~, !, @, #, $, %, ^, etc.) in the password.

Once you have made your choices, click the "Generate Password" button. The application will generate a random password based on your preferences and display it in the designated password field.

If you are not satisfied with the generated password, you can click the "Generate Password" button again to generate a new one.

Copy the generated password to use it in your desired application, such as online accounts, secure files, or any other password-protected areas.

# How it Works
The application uses JavaScript to handle the password generation process. It includes an array of special characters, numeric characters, lowercase characters, and uppercase characters. Based on the user's selections, the application combines these character arrays and ensures that at least one character from each selected type is included in the generated password. The remaining characters are then randomly selected from the available character pool to meet the desired password length. Finally, the password is shuffled to enhance its randomness.
